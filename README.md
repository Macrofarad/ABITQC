# A Brief Introduction to Quantum Computing from the Perspecitve of Ladder Logic

This document is not an exhaustive knowledge source.  It is targetted primarily towards undergraduates who are studying some form of electrical engineering; specifically, those who have had previous courses working with ladder logic.  It assumes some base knowledge of digital logic and is primarily meant to provide a foothold for said students in order to provide an easier start into an otherwise difficult topic.

The source code for this document is under the file ABITQC.tex; the PDF is the same name with a different file extension.  This name may change but if it does, the readme will be altered to reflect said changes.  

Any feedback is appreciated and edits by individuals skilled or knowledgable in the subject matter are always welcome.  If you see any inaccuracies or things such as wordings that could be changed for the sake of clarity, feel free to either message me, or utilize github to propose the changes.
