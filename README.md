# A Brief Introduction to Quantum Computing from the Perspecitve of Ladder Logic

This Paper is not an exhaustive knowledge source.  It is targetted primarily towards undergraduates who are studying some form of electrical engineering; specifically, those who have taken courses in ladder logic.  It assumes some base knowledge of digital logic and is primarily meant to provide a foothold for said students in order to provide an easier start into an otherwise difficult topic.
