		While Quantum Computing is a fairly advanced topic, it suffers from a perception of complexity beyond what is reasonable for the actual subject matter.  This paper provides a means to take that perception and bring it down to a more realistic level.  The primary targets of this paper are students currently enrolled in or freshly graduated from an electrical engineering or similar program; however, any individual with a base knowledge in programming or digital logic should be able to gain some level of benefit.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

%Explain the context of the experiment here. Why is condensed matter physics interesting or important?
%Optional things you could talk about (but don't have to -- this is up to you): transistors, computers, Quantum computers, fundamental knowledge (e.g. the resistance quantum).

%Briefly explain what methods you will use in the experiment, and what values you will extract from the data.

%For this section and all following sections: If you refer to an equation, previous result or theory that is not regarded as common knowledge, then cite the source (article or book) where you found this. For example, you can cite the Nano 3 Lecture notes \cite{nano3}.

%This section is for context.  The how, and why.  From here on out, if I refer to a theory that isn't common knowledge, cite the source. \cite{junctNew}.

Make no mistake, quantum physics as a whole is an exceptionally advanced topic.  The type of scenarios it brings to the table can be almost mind boggling at times \cite{mindBoggle}.  Add to this a slew of misleading analogies and the fact that "Qubit" may refer to any number of technologies, such as ion traps, superconducting qubits, or spin qubits and it's no wonder that people get confused.   With all of that said, while quantum computing does use the underlying principals of quantum mechanics, it is still nothing more than a programming architecture.  To put this statement in another context, an individual does not need to understand how to bias a transistor to be good at programming in C.

\subsection{Use Case for Quantum Computing} 
Quantum computing is what's called a Disruptive Emergent Technology.  Meaning, as far as industry is concerned, the implementation of these concepts have not only never been seen in any technology prior, but they also have the potential to revolutionize how things are done should these implementations prove successful.  Quantum computing is not a magic bullet that can handle every problem; however, it does have the potential to be exceptionally good at problems that current technology has issues solving.  Examples of such problems can be as varied as weather prediction, factoring \cite{shorsAlgorithm}, or even protein folding \cite{dwavepfold}. 

\subsection{Relevance to Reader} %AKA, why should you care
To avoid mincing words or dancing around the point, all that is fine, but this leads to the famous words (paraphrased ,of course) uttered at one point by nearly every person between the ages of twelve and nineteen: "Why should I care?".  To that, there are two primary categories of answers.  First, advances in technology usually creates a higher standard of living, in the case of quantum computing, these advances may end up finding the cure to debilitating ailments, reducing cost of living, or even allowing for a faster, more secure means to transport data (Quantum Internet \cite{qinternetNature}).  The second category deals with economics, the reality of the situation is that there aren't enough people who are skilled in this area to fit the demand \cite{qc5ycommercialize}.  Meaning, not only are jobs available to those with the skills to fill the required roles, but due to the shortage of supply when compared to the demand, these jobs generally pay quite well. 


\section{Background Concepts}
\label{sec:backgroundconcepts}
%brief intro to this section, needs rewording
%This section is not meant to be an exhaustive list, but, in my personal experience, learning about the background concepts below will greatly assist a person’s ability to better understand quantum computing.  The following sections will provide a brief explanation of the concepts.
In order to avoid excessive noise, this paper assumes the reader has some basic knowledge of programming as well as electronics.  It will not go into depth with much of the math, instead focusing primarily on the act of programming itself.  There are many topics which should be covered if one wishes to become skilled in quantum computing, most of which the reader will need to research on their own time; however, the sections below should provide enough context in order to provide a suitable foothold should one wish to continue with the subject.




\subsection{Removing Misleading Assumptions}
The first and easily one of the most important concepts in quantum computing is to understand that the general public and most media 'experts' do not work in the field of quantum computing.  Therefore, it is important to note that many of the common assumptions people tend to have can be misleading or plain wrong due to lack of context or the background knowledge required to properly articulate the concepts at hand.\newline
\newline
One prime example of this is Erwin Schrödinger and the concept of Schrödinger's cat.  To preface, this is not at all meant to downplay or discredit his work, merely to illustrate that without proper context even an otherwise correct statement from a Nobel laureate can be misconstrued.  \newline
\newline %helpful link to brush up https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_interpretation
To briefly summarize, Schrödinger's cat is a brilliant thought experiment meant to illustrate a potential paradox present within the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics.  This thought experiment was meant to highlight the bizarre nature of EPR (Einstein, Podolsky, Rosen), or superposition states.  This is demonstrated via a cat, radioactive particle, flask of poison, and a Geiger counter being sealed in a theoretical box.  Should the counter detect radioactivity, the flask would be broken causing the cat to die immediately.  Under the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, this cat should be considered simultaneously both alive and dead, however, looking into the sealed box will reveal either a very scared cat, or a testament to animals killed in the name of science. \newline
\newline
 In context, this is meant to demonstrate the concepts of complex, superimposed states collapsing upon measurement. For better or worse, this concept of a not dead, yet dead cat in a box has spread like wildfire, it has become the cornerstone of what the public sees as quantum computing. This has allowed the idea that the quantum state is both 1 and 0 to become the very first thing that anyone learns in regards to quantum computing.  While this statement is not technically wrong, it is fundamentally incomplete. In many ways, it's similar to the question "which came first: the chicken, or the egg?", the answer to which can only be something along the lines of 'invalid question', as it not only fails to define what denotes the term chicken, but it also leads the individual being asked to assume the term 'egg' is specifically in the context of a chicken egg. \newline
 \newline
 In reality, a better way to think of this is through vectors and complex numbers.  The value is in fact both 1 and 0, but it's that way not because it is two things in a binary sense, but because it is a complex mixing of both.  To put this back into cat analogies, let's take the premise back to the start.  There is a cat, that cat is now infected with a zombie pathogen.  For all purposes, the cat is neither alive, nor dead, as it cannot cleanly fit into either category, yet it does have many of the defining characteristics that comprise both.  From here, the cat is injected with an antidote,  being a rushed marvel of medicine meant to save the feline race, it will near instantly result in either a complete cure or certain death for our kitten subject.  For this analogy, the zombified state represents the ability of qubits to be in a mixed state, the antidote representing the act of measuring this mixed state and thus collapsing it into a binary value. %: 1 or 0, alive or dead.


\subsection{Balanced Ternary} %The basics from the ground up
%note: blanaced ternary is not, strictly speaking a core mechanic in quantum computing.  However, it could serve as a gentle introduction to non-binary coding for many students.  A bridge between hard digital and the strangeness of qubits

Balanced Ternary is not, strictly speaking a part of quantum computing, so with that knowledge, it may seem like a strange item to include as background information when discussing the subject. However, given this author's personal experience, it is nearly ideal to serve not only as a bridge to more advanced concepts but also as a demonstration of why said concepts are important. \newline
\newline
To do this, a brief nod to what numbers are at their core is needed. It's pretty obvious to most, but numbers are nothing more or less than a way to categorize quantity.  This concept of quantity is important as it is independent of stylistic choices such as base or notation.  In programming, binary is frequently used as it reflects the power state of transistors within the register.  For most general cases, this works quite well allowing for any number of tricks, or bit-hacks, to be employed to speed things up.  However, unsigned binary does have an Achilles' heel in that due to its basis in positive numbers, there is no simple way to show when a number is negative on hardware \footnote{Note: the "-" symbol seen in both binary and standard decimal is not a representation of quantity, it's more akin to a shorthand for the operation of 0 - Quantity, and thus it's fairly difficult to represent in hardware}.  To do so, one needs to employ a tactic such as the IEEE 754 standard, adding much more complexity than would otherwise be necessary.  One way to circumvent this issue is to use a balanced number system such as balanced ternary. \newline
\newline
These systems work by designating symbols as pre-signed.  In the case of balanced ternary, the symbols are designated as "0; +; -" and they represent "$3^{(s*n)}$" with "n" being the index number starting at zero from right to left and "s" being the sign as denoted by the "+" for positive, "-" for negative, or "0" for null quantity \footnote{ This notion of sign polarity being a property of quantity will become relevant in later sections (~\ref{ternaryRelevance}), but for now, it is acceptable to use this idea as a base case.}.  From there it is a simple matter of adding the positive and negative values up in order to get the end result (see Table~\ref{tab:ternary}, for example and comparison between bases).

\begin{table} %Table used to illustrate comparison between bases
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{l|l|l} % Justification l-left, c-center, r-right

	\end{tabular}
	\caption{\label{tab:ternary}comparison table showing equivalent numbers in different display forms}
\end{table}
\subsection{Vectors}
\label{THISNEEDSACCURACYREVIEW} % Getting into nitpick notation stuff, need to be careful
A proper discussion of quantum computing cannot be had without discussing vectors and their function in understanding the circuit.  This will be discussed more in a later section (\ref{Qubits}); however, the shorthand version is as follows.  Due to the fact that quantum computers operate on qubits rather than classical (binary) bits, a quantum computer is effectively nothing more than a very complex probabilistic vector equation. To be specific, this state space $\mathcal{H}$, is not just vector space but a Hilbert space, meaning it has a positive-definite Hermitian inner product $\bra{\cdot}\ket{\cdot}$.  This has quite a few implications and entire papers can be written on the vector space alone, but in simple terms what it means is that the sum of the probabilities of a quantum computer being in any given state post measurement will always be 1.

\subsubsection{Notation}
%https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/214728/braket-notation-in-latex
In quantum computing, and quantum mechanics as a whole for that matter the standard notation is Bra-Ket notation, also known as Dirac notation. Example: $\bra{\phi}\ket{\psi}$. The right part, called ket, is typically represented as a column vector and written as $\ket{\psi}$. The left part, called bra, is the Hermitian conjugate of the ket with the same label, is typically represented as a row vector and written as $\bra{\phi}$. \newline
\newline
This may seem like a bit much for those whom have never worked with this sort of thing before, but the following example should help clarify things.\newline
$\ket{\psi}=\alpha\ket{H} + \beta\ket{V}$ \newline
What the above example notates is the simplest meaningful version of a quantum system that can be in two possible states, for example the polarization of a photon. When measured, the system will collapse into either the horizontal state $\ket{H}$ or the vertical state $\ket{V}$, until that moment it exists in a superposition of the two.  To find the probability of the system collapsing into a given state upon measurement, simply take the multiplier in front of the desired ket and square it.  For instance, in the case of finding the probability of a vertical state the answer would be $\beta^2$. \newline
\newline
Back to the previous section, the fact that the sum of the probability of all possible states is equal to 1 was brought up.  This can be notated as:\newline
$\sum\psi^{*}_{n} \psi_{n}=1$ \newline
This will be discussed in more detail in the qubit section (\ref{Qubits}) in regards to what are called bloch spheres. % don't go too deep into superposition yet

\subsection{Reversible Logic Gates} %The basics from the ground up
%there was a time when reversible logic was seen as a fatal flaw in QC, but some dude who was pretty clever figured out any standard logic gate could be simulated within reversible logic
A more advanced concept that is still core to quantum computing is the idea of reversible logic gates. Normally when it comes to digital logic inputs and outputs are decoupled. Consider the digital logic circuit as seen in Figure~\ref{Circuit:1}.  In this circuit, there are three inputs and a single output, even knowing the gate layout and the end value of $f_{1}$, the best that could be done for determining the input values is narrowing it to a range of possibilities as all the values have been combined into one, irreversible output. Now consider the reversible logic circuit as seen in Figure~\ref{Circuit:2}, while the notation may be unfamiliar\footnote{This notation is that of a simple quantum ladder logic circuit, the elements of which will be covered in section~\ref{QladderLogicHere}}, each input has its own unique output.  Due to this, so long as one knows what gates are in the circuit and what the output values are, the input values can be derived relatively easily.

\section{Quantum Coding}
This section deals in the various coding languages utilized in programming quantum computers.  As these languages are still in active development, expect this section to change frequently.

\subsection{Quantum Ladder Logic}
\label{QladderLogicHere} %referenced in a previous section
%brief explanation of this stuff
\subsubsection{Qubits} %another section to check details heavily, might raise it up a level and move other things around
\label{Qubits}
Into the meat of the matter, qubits are to quantum computers what register bits are to a classical computer. A qubit is a two-state quantum mechanical system such as photon polarization or the spin of a trapped ion.

\paragraph{Bloch Sphere} %lots of nested sections in this area

See Figure~\ref{bloch1} for visual.  A Bloch sphere is a geometrical representation of the pure state space of a two level quantum mechanical system (qubit).\newline
\newline
Since the total probability of the system has to be one: $\bra{\psi}\ket{\psi}=1$ this gives us the constraint required in order to write $\ket{\psi}$  using the following representation. \newline
$\ket{\psi}=\cos(\dfrac{\theta}{2})\ket{0} + e^{i\phi}\sin(\dfrac{\theta}{2})\ket{1}=\cos(\dfrac{\theta}{2})\ket{0}+(cos(\phi)+i\sin(\phi))\sin(\dfrac{\theta}{2})\ket{1}$ \newline
Where $0\leq\theta\leq\pi$. \newline
\newline
All of that is a bit of a mouth-full, so to speak, but for most practical purposes, the Bloch sphere is one of the best tools to visually understand and debug a quantum circuit on the qubit level when it is an option that is available.

% Would be worthwhile to list how to find the X, Y, and Z components of the vector from a given sphere or visa versa

\subsubsection{Quantum Gates} %another mention of http://www.vcpc.univie.ac.at/~ian/hotlist/qc/talks/bloch-sphere-rotations.pdf
%turns out they have an exceptionally good explanation of Pauli gates

Much like a digital logic gate operates on an individual or set of classical bits, a Quantum gate operates on individual or sets of qubits.  Given that each qubit is effectively a matrix, quantum gates are matrices which are used to modify the vector space. % Fact check, it's basically right, but after going on for a page about context and stuff, the last thing I want to do is be inaccurate.
\paragraph{Single-Qubit Gates}
%Pauli gates
\label{pauliGates} %this section is important

Of the single qubit gates, generally the most well known and frequently used are the Pauli gates.

\paragraph{Multi-Qubit Gates}
%advanced Gates

\subsection{Quantum Assembly Language}



\section{Experiment} % 1-2 pages
This section contains information on experiments performed on both real world quantum computers as well as simulations and approximations of quantum computers.

%discuss pros and cons of each system, language, interface etc.

\subsection{IBM Quantum Experience}
%basic sum of it
When this project first began, IBM's Quantum Experience (IBMQE) was still very young.  It was and still is revolutionary in that it gave registered users the ability to program and test code on real quantum computers.
\subsubsection{Ladder logic} % cite sources for JJ stuff
For most users of IBMQE this is the primary thing they'll see.  It's a standard ladder logic interface and because of this, it is fairly intuitive.  With that said, because IBMQE is running on real hardware, it suffers from the restrictions of said hardware.  Qubits here are implemented physically via Pi Josephson Junctions, effectively a superconducting anharmonic oscillator.  This means that the frequency a qubit is oscillating at determines what qubits it can interact with.  Speaking from experience, to a new user that is extremely confusing if one isn't given an explanation.  The interface also lacks many basic multi-qubit gates due to their physical implementation not being possible at current time.\newline
\newline
IBMQE can move into a pure simulation mode, but it lacks the live feedback to properly make that mode seem responsive.  Where it does excel is in the next section, Quantum Assembly language (QASM).
\subsubsection{QASM} %redo wording
In addition to the ability to program in ladder logic, IBMQE allows users to code their circuits in QASM.  This feature is extremely powerful as users can not only code in ladder logic or QASM, but they can also flip between them depending on what view best suits their needs.  A skilled user can easily define custom gates based on matrices should the standard pauli gates not be sufficient.  

%\subsubsection{Limitations} % Reserve, should be covered pretty well in previous sections
\subsection{QISKit}%API called from external code


\subsection{Quirk}%Easily one of the best interfaces
\subsubsection{What it is}
Quirk is an idealized, online drag-and-drop quantum circuit simulator. This simulator is hosted on Craig Gidney's block Algorithmic Assertions\cite{algoassert}.  It is open source and due to the fact that he works as a part of Google's Quantum AI Team, it is owned by Google.
\subsubsection{Pros}%make better name
Among all currently available quantum simulation interfaces, this one stands out from the crowd.  It is responsive, accessible online without having to download software and extremely intuitive.  All in all, it's an excellent place to begin learning about quantum computing, especially given that the blog hosting it has a plethora of articles about the inner workings of many quantum algorithms.
\subsubsection{Cons}%Also needs a better name
For all this interface brings to the table, there is one very important thing that it does not do.  Quirk is incapable of interfacing with a live quantum computer via API or otherwise; moreover, given the fact that circuits are stored as URL's to be generated, this severely limits how well the code can store as all it takes to lose a code is accidentally overwriting the clipboard or text document that said circuit is stored within.


\section{Results and Interpretation}% 2-3 pages
\label{currentSpot} %to find where I last left off
\begin{comment}
Show a graph of the longitudinal resistivity ($\rho_{xx}$) and Hall resistivity ($\rho_{xy}$) versus magnetic field, extracted from the raw data shown in figure \ref{fig:data}. You will have the link to the data in your absalon messages, if not e-mail Guen (guen@nbi.dk). Explain how you calculated these values, and refer to the theory.
\end{comment}
\subsection{Source Code}


\subsection{Analysis} %First person should be fine for this section given that it's commentary
Given that the goal of this project was to teach myself the basics of quantum computing and provide a path for other undergraduates to do the same, this project was a resounding success.  In the scope of this project, I taught myself the following languages: Quantum Ladder Logic, Quantum Assembly Language, Q\# (Microsoft's Quantum Computing language), LaTeX, CSS, and how to work with QISKit a specific coding API for quantum computers which is written in Python.\newline
\newline
In addition to the coding languages this project enabled me to pursue, I was able to meet with multiple professionals in the industry of Quantum Computing, from PhD's in quantum physics, to up and coming startups.  Moreover, the knowledge and source material required for this project to happen has also been requested by multiple professors at varied levels of teaching.  Partly
