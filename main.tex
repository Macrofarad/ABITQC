While Quantum Computing is a fairly advanced topic, it suffers from a perception of complexity beyond what is reasonable for the actual subject matter.  This paper provides a means to take that perception and bring it down to a more realistic level.  The primary targets of this paper are students currently enrolled in or freshly graduated from an electrical engineering or similar program; however, any individual with a base knowledge in programming or digital logic should be able to gain some level of benefit.

Keywords:  Quantum, QISKit, Computing, Ladder, Logic, QASM, Introduction
% Need to reword this section, Find the abstract from source and merge the two
% Author note: the intention of this paper is to fill some of the skill gap many novices encounter in learning quantum computing.  By no means should this be considered an all-encompassing guide to the subject matter.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

%Explain the context of the experiment here. Why is condensed matter physics interesting or important?
%Optional things you could talk about (but don't have to -- this is up to you): transistors, computers, Quantum computers, fundamental knowledge (e.g. the resistance quantum).

%Briefly explain what methods you will use in the experiment, and what values you will extract from the data.

%For this section and all following sections: If you refer to an equation, previous result or theory that is not regarded as common knowledge, then cite the source (article or book) where you found this. For example, you can cite the Nano 3 Lecture notes \cite{nano3}.

%This section is for context.  The how, and why.  From here on out, if I refer to a theory that isn't common knowledge, cite the source. \cite{junctNew}.

Make no mistake, quantum physics as a whole is an exceptionally advanced topic.  The type of scenarios it brings to the table can be almost mind boggling at times \cite{mindBoggle}.  Add to this a slew of misleading analogies and the fact that "Qubit" may refer to any number of technologies, such as ion traps, superconducting qubits, or spin qubits and it's no wonder that people get confused.   With all of that said, while quantum computing does use the underlying principals of quantum mechanics, it is still nothing more than a programming architecture.  To put this statement in another context, an individual does not need to understand how to bias a transistor to be good at programming in C.

\subsection{Use Case for Quantum Computing} 
Quantum computing is what's called a Disruptive Emergent Technology.  Meaning, as far as industry is concerned, the implementation of these concepts have not only never been seen in any technology prior, but they also have the potential to revolutionize how things are done should these implementations prove successful.  Quantum computing is not a magic bullet that can handle every problem; however, it does have the potential to be exceptionally good at problems that current technology has issues solving.  Examples of such problems can be as varied as weather prediction, factoring \cite{shorsAlgorithm}, or even protein folding \cite{dwavepfold}. 

\subsection{Relevance to Reader} %AKA, why should you care
To avoid mincing words or dancing around the point, all that is fine, but this leads to the famous words (paraphrased ,of course) uttered at one point by nearly every person between the ages of twelve and nineteen: "Why should I care?".  To that, there are two primary categories of answers.  First, advances in technology usually creates a higher standard of living, in the case of quantum computing, these advances may end up finding the cure to debilitating ailments, reducing cost of living, or even allowing for a faster, more secure means to transport data (Quantum Internet \cite{qinternetNature}).  The second category deals with economics, the reality of the situation is that there aren't enough people who are skilled in this area to fit the demand \cite{qc5ycommercialize}.  Meaning, not only are jobs available to those with the skills to fill the required roles, but due to the shortage of supply when compared to the demand, these jobs generally pay quite well. 


\section{Background Concepts}
\label{sec:backgroundconcepts}
%brief intro to this section, needs rewording
%This section is not meant to be an exhaustive list, but, in my personal experience, learning about the background concepts below will greatly assist a person’s ability to better understand quantum computing.  The following sections will provide a brief explanation of the concepts.
In order to avoid excessive noise, this paper assumes the reader has some basic knowledge of programming as well as electronics.  It will not go into depth with much of the math, instead focusing primarily on the act of programming itself.  There are many topics which should be covered if one wishes to become skilled in quantum computing, most of which the reader will need to research on their own time; however, the sections below should provide enough context in order to provide a suitable foothold should one wish to continue with the subject.




\subsection{Removing Misleading Assumptions}
The first and easily one of the most important concepts in quantum computing is to understand that the general public and most media 'experts' do not work in the field of quantum computing.  Therefore, it is important to note that many of the common assumptions people tend to have can be misleading or plain wrong due to lack of context or the background knowledge required to properly articulate the concepts at hand.\newline
\newline
One prime example of this is Erwin Schrödinger and the concept of Schrödinger's cat.  To preface, this is not at all meant to downplay or discredit his work, merely to illustrate that without proper context even an otherwise correct statement from a Nobel laureate can be misconstrued.  \newline
\newline %helpful link to brush up https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_interpretation
To briefly summarize, Schrödinger's cat is a brilliant thought experiment meant to illustrate a potential paradox present within the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics.  This thought experiment was meant to highlight the bizarre nature of EPR (Einstein, Podolsky, Rosen), or superposition states.  This is demonstrated via a cat, radioactive particle, flask of poison, and a Geiger counter being sealed in a theoretical box.  Should the counter detect radioactivity, the flask would be broken causing the cat to die immediately.  Under the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, this cat should be considered simultaneously both alive and dead, however, looking into the sealed box will reveal either a very scared cat, or a testament to animals killed in the name of science. \newline
\newline
 In context, this is meant to demonstrate the concepts of complex, superimposed states collapsing upon measurement. For better or worse, this concept of a not dead, yet dead cat in a box has spread like wildfire, it has become the cornerstone of what the public sees as quantum computing. This has allowed the idea that the quantum state is both 1 and 0 to become the very first thing that anyone learns in regards to quantum computing.  While this statement is not technically wrong, it is fundamentally incomplete. In many ways, it's similar to the question "which came first: the chicken, or the egg?", the answer to which can only be something along the lines of 'invalid question', as it not only fails to define what denotes the term chicken, but it also leads the individual being asked to assume the term 'egg' is specifically in the context of a chicken egg. \newline
 \newline
 In reality, a better way to think of this is through vectors and complex numbers.  The value is in fact both 1 and 0, but it's that way not because it is two things in a binary sense, but because it is a complex mixing of both.  To put this back into cat analogies, let's take the premise back to the start.  There is a cat, that cat is now infected with a zombie pathogen.  For all purposes, the cat is neither alive, nor dead, as it cannot cleanly fit into either category, yet it does have many of the defining characteristics that comprise both.  From here, the cat is injected with an antidote,  being a rushed marvel of medicine meant to save the feline race, it will near instantly result in either a complete cure or certain death for our kitten subject.  For this analogy, the zombified state represents the ability of qubits to be in a mixed state, the antidote representing the act of measuring this mixed state and thus collapsing it into a binary value. %: 1 or 0, alive or dead.


\subsection{Balanced Ternary} %The basics from the ground up
%note: blanaced ternary is not, strictly speaking a core mechanic in quantum computing.  However, it could serve as a gentle introduction to non-binary coding for many students.  A bridge between hard digital and the strangeness of qubits

Balanced Ternary is not, strictly speaking a part of quantum computing, so with that knowledge, it may seem like a strange item to include as background information when discussing the subject. However, given this author's personal experience, it is nearly ideal to serve not only as a bridge to more advanced concepts but also as a demonstration of why said concepts are important. \newline
\newline
To do this, a brief nod to what numbers are at their core is needed. It's pretty obvious to most, but numbers are nothing more or less than a way to categorize quantity.  This concept of quantity is important as it is independent of stylistic choices such as base or notation.  In programming, binary is frequently used as it reflects the power state of transistors within the register.  For most general cases, this works quite well allowing for any number of tricks, or bit-hacks, to be employed to speed things up.  However, unsigned binary does have an Achilles' heel in that due to its basis in positive numbers, there is no simple way to show when a number is negative on hardware \footnote{Note: the "-" symbol seen in both binary and standard decimal is not a representation of quantity, it's more akin to a shorthand for the operation of 0 - Quantity, and thus it's fairly difficult to represent in hardware}.  To do so, one needs to employ a tactic such as the IEEE 754 standard, adding much more complexity than would otherwise be necessary.  One way to circumvent this issue is to use a balanced number system such as balanced ternary. \newline
\newline
These systems work by designating symbols as pre-signed.  In the case of balanced ternary, the symbols are designated as "0; +; -" and they represent "$3^{(s*n)}$" with "n" being the index number starting at zero from right to left and "s" being the sign as denoted by the "+" for positive, "-" for negative, or "0" for null quantity \footnote{ This notion of sign polarity being a property of quantity will become relevant in later sections (~\ref{ternaryRelevance}), but for now, it is acceptable to use this idea as a base case.}.  From there it is a simple matter of adding the positive and negative values up in order to get the end result (see Table~\ref{tab:ternary}, for example and comparison between bases).

\begin{table} %Table used to illustrate comparison between bases
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{l|l|l} % Justification l-left, c-center, r-right

	\end{tabular}
	\caption{\label{tab:ternary}comparison table showing equivalent numbers in different display forms}
\end{table}
\subsection{Vectors}
\label{THISNEEDSACCURACYREVIEW} % Getting into nitpick notation stuff, need to be careful
A proper discussion of quantum computing cannot be had without discussing vectors and their function in understanding the circuit.  This will be discussed more in a later section (~\ref{Qubits}); however, the shorthand version is as follows.  Due to the fact that quantum computers operate on qubits rather than classical (binary) bits, a quantum computer is effectively nothing more than a very complex probabilistic vector equation. To be specific, this state space $\mathcal{H}$, is not just vector space but a Hilbert space, meaning it has a positive-definite Hermitian inner product $\bra{\cdot}\ket{\cdot}$.  This has quite a few implications and entire papers can be written on the vector space alone, but in simple terms what it means is that the sum of the probabilities of a quantum computer being in any given state post measurement will always be 1.

\subsubsection{Notation}
%https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/214728/braket-notation-in-latex
In quantum computing, and quantum mechanics as a whole for that matter the standard notation is Bra-Ket notation, also known as Dirac notation. \newline $\bra{\phi}\ket{\psi}$ \newline
The right part, called ket, is typically represented as a column vector and written as $\ket{\psi}$.

The left part, called bra, is the Hermitian conjugate of the ket with the same label, is typically represented as a row vector and written as $\bra{\phi}$.

\subsection{Reversible Logic Gates} %The basics from the ground up
%there was a time when reversible logic was seen as a fatal flaw in QC, but some dude who was pretty clever figured out any standard logic gate could be simulated within reversible logic
A more advanced concept that is still core to quantum computing is the idea of reversible logic gates. Normally when it comes to digital logic inputs and outputs are decoupled. Consider the digital logic circuit as seen in Figure~\ref{Circuit:1}.  In this circuit, there are three inputs and a single output, even knowing the gate layout and the end value of $f_{1}$, the best that could be done for determining the input values is narrowing it to a range of possibilities as all the values have been combined into one, irreversible output. Now consider the reversible logic circuit as seen in Figure~\ref{Circuit:2}, while the notation may be unfamiliar\footnote{This notation is that of a simple quantum ladder logic circuit, the elements of which will be covered in section~\ref{QladderLogicHere}}, each input has its own unique output.  Due to this, so long as one knows what gates are in the circuit and what the output values are, the input values can be derived relatively easily.

\begin{equation}
S_n = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n}{n}
      = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n} X_i
\label{equationNotation}
